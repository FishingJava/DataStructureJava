Sam is part of the organizing team arranging the university's career fair and has list of companies 
and their respective arrival times and durations. due to university-wide budget cuts. there is only one stage/dis
 available on the entire campus so only one event can occur at a time. Given each company's arrival time and the duration 
 they will stay. determine the maximum number of promotional events that can hosted during the career fair. 
 
 Example 
   n = 5
   arrival = [1,3,3,5,7]
   duration = [2,2,1,2,1]
