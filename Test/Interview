Write a function   
     Class solution { public int [] solution(int N): }
     that given an integer N(1<=N<=100) return an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. The function can return any such array. 
     for example given N=4, the function could return [1,0.-3, 2] or [-2,1,-4,5]. The answer[1,-1,1,3] would be incorrect (b/s value 1
     occurs twice). for N =3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] (but there are many more correct answers)
